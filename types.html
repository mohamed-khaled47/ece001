               the current situation. Reactive AI machines cannot form inferences from the data to evaluate their future actions.
                They can perform a narrowed range of pre-defined tasks.</p></td>
            <td><p>Like the name suggests Limited Memory AI, can make informed and improved decisions by studying the past data
               from its memory. Such an AI has a short-lived or a temporary memory that can be used to store past experiences 
               and hence evaluate future actions.</p></td>
            <td><p>The Theory Of Mind AI is a more advanced type of Artificial Intelligence. This category of machines is 
              speculated to play a major role in psychology. This type of AI will focus mainly on emotional intelligence so 
              that human believes and thoughts can be better comprehended.</p></td>
            <td><p>Self-aware AI involves machines that have human-level consciousness. This form of AI is not currently in 
              existence, but would be considered the most advanced form of artificial intelligence known to man.</p></td>
