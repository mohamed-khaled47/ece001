  <h3><li><b>Azure Machine Learning</b></li></h3>
  <p>If you don't have advanced programming skills but are looking to get into machine learning, you should check out 
    Azure Machine Learning. (Note that you should have some knowledge of machine learning and data science to truly 
    benefit from using this platform.) This cloud-based service provides tooling for deploying predictive models as 
    analytic solutions. It can also be used to test machine learning models, run algorithms, and create recommender 
    systems, to name a few. However, it's been criticized for its poor performance and unintuitive UI, particularly 
    when it comes to writing code.</p>
  <h3><li><b>Caffe</b></li></h3>
  <p>Developed by Yangqin Jia, Caffe was created as part of Jia's Ph.D. research while at UC Berkeley.
     Now, it's an open-source framework for deep learning that supports various types of software architectures that 
     were designed with image segmentation and image classification in mind. Caffe is touted for its easily readable 
     source code and its quality of performance. Some negatives that have been pointed out are that you need to write 
     new layers in Cude/C++ and it's difficult to use when writing protofiles for large networks.</p>
  <h3><li><b>CNTK</b></li></h3>
  <p>CNTK (Computational Network Toolkit) is a deep learning toolkit developed by Microsoft that 
    "describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph." It can be used to help you 
    easily combine different types of neural networks, has great performance, allows for distributed training, and is 
    flexible. On the flip side, it has no easily readable source code and lacks in the visualization department.</p>
    <h3><li><b>IBM Watson</b></li></h3>
    <p>IBM Watson is called a "question answering machine." It uses analytical powers and artificial
       intelligence to replicate human-like abilities to respond to questions optimally. It can help you make great
       business insights and make informed decisions based on thoroughly informed decisions. IBM also ensures that your 
       data is protected with world-class security and encryption capabilities and that they will not share your data 
       unless you say that they can. On the other hand, its disadvantages include that it is only available in English, 
       it doesn't process structured data directly, and switching and integrating come with high costs.</p>
   <h3><li><b>Torch</b></li> </h3>
   <p>Torch is an open-source framework for scientific computing that supports machine learning 
     algorithms. It is powered by LuaJIT, a scripting language that allows developers to code in C while interacting 
     with Torch, and an underlying C/CUDA implementation. Some of Torche's prominent features, as listed on their website
     , are "a powerful N-dimensional array; linear algebra routines; neural network, and energy-based models; fast 
     and efficient GPU support." Additionally, it can be ported to iOS and Android backends. Some drawbacks to Torch 
     that have been pointed out include that fact that loading data from directories can prove difficult at times, and 
     its reliance on Lua (a relatively new language) makes it less accessible.</p>
